            The internet moves fast. Platforms rise and fall in popularity,
            websites disappear, links go bad, and domains lapse. Some things
            shouldn’t disappear and deserve to last.
          </p>

          <p>
            At WordPress.com, we believe in building for the long term. That’s
            why we’re introducing 100-Year Domains and relaunching our 100-Year
            Plan—two powerful ways to secure your digital legacy for generations
            to come.

              >100-Year Domains</a

            <code>.net</code>, or <code>.blog</code> domain
            <strong>for a full century</strong>—ensuring that what you create
            today remains accessible for the future and safeguarded from
            expiration, platform changes, and digital decay.
          </p>

              >Our 100-Year Plan</a

            introducing new features that ensure your website and data are

              WordPress.com stores all of your data in at least three separately
              mirrored data centers to ensure access and redundancy in the event
              of failures or disasters. In addition, 100-Year Plan websites will
              have active snapshot backups in the Internet Archive’s Wayback
              Machine and the Wayback Linkfixer plugin to redirect any links
              that go bad on your site to the most recent one at the Internet
              Archive.

            years, ensuring your identity and legacy remain yours—without the
            risk of expiration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Normally, domain names can only be registered for 10 years at a
            time. But with our 100-Year Domains, we start with a 10-year
            registration and handle renewals automatically by adding a year to
            registration annually so there is always at least a nine-year
            buffer.

            Why creating a lasting legacy matters more than ever
          </h2>

          <p>The web is fragile. Domains and hosting plans expire.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            This is how history gets lost. The 100-Year Plan and 100-Year
            Domains fight back against this digital impermanence—ensuring that
            your work, your name, your mission, and your voice remain accessible
            far beyond the limits of today’s platforms and policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Imagine including the next 100 years of website hosting fees in the
            same budget as your next website build or update. You’re locking in
            a one-time hosting or domain payment now, even if and when prices
            rise in the future.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sub-heading">Secure your digital future today</h2>

          <p>
            Domains expire and websites disappear every day. But yours doesn’t
            have to.&nbsp;
